    * Bug Fixes. 
      1) The main loop counter was incorrectly incremented after writing the 
         buffer and not actually reading any new particles causing id's to 
         be wrong and data to be truncated.
      2) An empty mass block was written even when all the mass values were
         specified in the header.
      3) The output directory was not properly defaulting to "." but rather
         the directory of the input file.
